Linux System Administrator Projects

Scratch Your Own Itch

Find a real need you have and fill it using a Linux based solution. This is one of the most rewarding ways to learn Linux. For example,

    Do you need somewhere to store work related documentation or notes? Then install a Wiki on Linux.
    Want to start a blog? Host it on Linux!
    Want to stream online content to your TV or other devices in your home? Then build a Linux media server.

The next time you have a technical need and want to get some extra Linux practice, see if you can solve your problem with Linux.
Configure the LAMP Stack

LAMP stands for Linux Apache MySQL and PHP. It’s a very common architecture for web applications. If you think about the LAMP stack in broad terms you have an operating system (Linux), a web server (Apache), a database tier (MySQL), and a programming language (PHP). You can substitue different solutions for each component. Try configuring the LAMP stack on CentOS, then Ubuntu. Instead of using Apache you could use NGINX or lighttpd. For the database you could use PostgreSQL, MariaDB, or MongoDB. Instead of using PHP, why not try Python?
